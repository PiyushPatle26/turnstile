## This is the configuration file for dinit-userservd.
##
## The daemon will function even without a configuration
## file, but the values here reflect the built-in defaults.
##
## The syntax is a simple line-by-line list of values.
## Values are case-sensitive. Whitespace around the
## assignment (=) as well as any leading and trailing
## whitespace is ignored. Only 1024 characters at most
## are read per line, including whitespace.
##
## Lines starting with # are considered comments. Lines
## that fail to parse are ignored. Invalid values are
## ignored (configuration will be unchanged).

# Whether to output debug information. This is verbose
# logging that is only useful when investigating issues.
#
# Valid values are 'yes' and 'no'.
#
debug = no

# Whether to print debug messages also to stderr.
#
# Valid values are 'yes' and 'no'.
#
debug_stderr = no

# The value of XDG_RUNTIME_DIR that is exported into the
# user service environment. Special values '%u' (user ID),
# '%g' (group ID) and '%%' (the character %) are allowed
# and substituted in the string. Set to empty string if
# you want to prevent it from being exported altogether.
#
rundir_path = @RUN_PATH@/user/%u

# Whether to manage the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR. By default, it
# is assumed that something else manages it (typically
# this is elogind). If you are not running anything that
# manages the directory, you can turn this on.
#
# Valid values are 'yes' and 'no'.
#
manage_rundir = no

# Whether to export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS into the
# environment. When enabled, this will be exported and
# set to 'unix:path=RUNDIR/bus' where RUNDIR is the
# expanded value of rundir_path. This works regardless
# of if rundir is managed.
#
# Valid values are 'yes' and 'no'.
#
export_dbus_address = yes
